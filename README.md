Project Title: Network Routing Protocols Configuration and Simulation using Cisco Packet Tracer.
Configured and simulated a complex network environment using Cisco Packet Tracer.
Implemented various routing protocols including RIP, EIGRP, OSPF, and BGP.
Analyzed and optimized network performance through the use of static and dynamic routing protocols.
Ensured proper route propagation and network stability across multiple areas using OSPF inter-area and EIGRP external configurations.
