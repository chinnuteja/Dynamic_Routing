Cloud Network Simulation
This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a cloud-based network architecture using Cisco Packet Tracer and Terraform for provisioning cloud resources in Azure. The project configures and optimizes multiple routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, BGP) for efficient network traffic management across a hybrid cloud environment.

Tools Used:
Cisco Packet Tracer: Network simulation tool used to design and simulate the network.
Terraform: Infrastructure-as-code tool used to provision Azure Virtual Network and subnets.
Azure: Cloud platform used for provisioning network resources and managing cloud-based infrastructure.
Routing Protocols: RIP, OSPF, and BGP for dynamic routing and route propagation.

Project Features:
Cloud Network Design: Designed a basic cloud network topology with multiple subnets and routing protocols.
Dynamic Routing: Configured RIP, OSPF, and BGP for optimal traffic management and routing efficiency.
Scalability & Redundancy: Ensured network scalability and redundancy to meet cloud infrastructure needs.
Performance Monitoring: Utilized Azure Monitor to track and analyze network performance, ensuring stability and reliability.
